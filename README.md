## ▶️ Run Locally
Because this is a static site, you can open `index.html` directly in your browser,
or run a local server to avoid CORS restrictions for assets.

### Option 1: Open directly
1. Double-click `index.html` to open it in your browser.

### Option 2: Run a local server (recommended)
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```
Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
